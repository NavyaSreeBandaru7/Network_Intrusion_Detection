## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Advanced Network Intrusion Detection System, please help us maintain the security of the project by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@[yourdomain].com**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce** the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress weekly
4. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
5. **Credit**: With your permission, we will credit you in our security advisories
